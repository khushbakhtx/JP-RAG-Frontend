# **JP-RAG System**

[Backend Repository](https://github.com/khushbakhtx/JP-RAG-Backend)

[Demo Video](https://youtu.be/ylLKuNwwqjA)

**JP-RAG** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project designed to interact with and provide insights from the books *12 Rules for Life* and *Beyond Order: 12 More Rules* by Jordan Peterson. This system uses modern AI techniques to retrieve relevant content from the books and generate meaningful, context-aware responses to user queries.

**Q90: 37.8529 seconds**

**Q99: 37.9644 seconds**

## **Features**
- **Conversational AI**: A chat-like interface for seamless user interaction.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Uses semantic search to retrieve relevant content from the books based on user queries.
- **Contextual Generation**: Leverages a language model to generate insightful answers based on retrieved content.
- **Interactive UI**: A React-based frontend for intuitive and engaging user experiences.
- **Keyboard Support**: Supports both "Send" button and **Enter** key for submitting questions.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Books were chunked into smaller, meaningful sections (each rule was treated as a content chunk).
   - These chunks were embedded using **HuggingFace embeddings** for semantic search.
   
2. **RAG Workflow**:
   - **Retriever**: Searches for the most relevant chunks from the vector store based on user input.
   - **Generator**: Generates a detailed and contextual response using a language model (LLM).
   
3. **Frontend**:
   - Built with **React** to provide a dynamic chat interface.
   - Displays conversation history and allows users to toggle between various views (Chat, Help, Activity, Settings).

4. **Backend**:
   - Developed using **FastAPI**, providing endpoints for handling queries.
   - Manages the RAG pipeline and communicates with the React frontend.

## **Technologies Used**
### **Backend**
- **FastAPI**: Lightweight Python framework for building APIs.
- **Chroma/FAISS**: Vector store for efficient semantic search.
- **HuggingFace Transformers**: For generating embeddings and leveraging pre-trained models.
- **Sentence-Transformers**: Used for embedding text chunks.

### **Frontend**
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Axios**: For making API calls to the backend.

### **Other Tools**
- **HuggingFace API**: Used for text generation in the RAG pipeline.
- **Python**: Primary language for backend development.
- **Markdown**: For documentation.

## **Setup Instructions**
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jp-rag.git
cd jp-rag
```

### **2. Install Backend Dependencies**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Start the Backend Server**
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### **4. Install Frontend Dependencies**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### **5. Start the Frontend Server**
```bash
npm start
```

---

## **Key Functionalities**
### **Retriever**
- The retriever searches for the most relevant content from the vector store using semantic embeddings.
- Embeddings are generated using the **"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"** model from HuggingFace.

### **Generator**
- The generator utilizes an LLM **"meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct"** via HuggingFace API to generate contextually relevant responses.

### **Frontend**
- Provides a chat interface for interacting with the RAG system.
- Supports toggling between different views:
  - **Chat**: Main interface for querying the RAG system.
  - **Help**: Offers guidance for using the system.
  - **Activity**: Displays recent interactions.
  - **Settings**: Customizable options for the user.

## **Challenges Faced**
1. **Slow Response Time**: Initially, responses were delayed due to the gradual typing effect. Resolved by optimizing the display logic to show the full response immediately while retaining typing effects.
2. **Chunking the Books**: Balancing chunk size for efficient retrieval without losing context was a challenge.
3. **Frontend-Backend Communication**: Ensured seamless integration between React and FastAPI using Axios.
